*** Configuration Files
The server loads it's configuration options from =commontConfig.json=
and, depending on whether the server is set up for local testing or
deployment, =localConfig.json= or =nonLocalConfig.json=. The non/local
configuration files mostly hold information about how to connect to
the database. The common configuration file that is always loaded
holds things like what port the server is created on.
