* Blocksworld Client
** Usage
See the server [[../server/README.org][README]] for details.
** Implementation
The client makes extensive use of the socket.io library to communicate
with the server. It is /strongly/ recommended that you look into the
diagrams stored in the docs folder to get an understanding of how the
interface works.
** Tests
We use [[https://jasmine.github.io/2.9/introduction.html][jasmine]] as our testing framework. The different test specs are
stored in the =spec/= folder. To get started, type:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  npm install jasmine
  npx jasmine
#+END_SRC
